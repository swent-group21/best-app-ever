# Expo Documentation

Using expo locally as our simulation environment.

**Note: WE WILL BE TESTING USING DOCKER AS A UNIFORM CONTAINER**
Check the Docker documentation for more information. [Docker Documentation](./docker.md)

## Start the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will open the Expo Developer Tools in your browser. You can scan the QR code with the Expo Go app (available on iOS and Android) to run the app on your physical device, or you can use an emulator/simulator.

### Running on a Physical Device

1. Download the **Expo Go** app from the App Store ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779)) or Google Play ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en)).

2. Open the Expo Go app and scan the QR code displayed in the terminal or browser.

### Running on an Emulator/Simulator

- For iOS: You need to have Xcode installed. You can open the app in the iOS simulator by pressing `i` in the terminal. Here are the steps to take [iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- For Android: You need to have Android Studio installed. You can open the app in the Android emulator by pressing `a` in the terminal. Here are the steps to take [Android Simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
